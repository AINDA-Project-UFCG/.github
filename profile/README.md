## AINDA PROJECT UFCG

AINDA (in Portuguese, "Análise Inteligente de Debates") is a research community in computer science and linguistics focused on producing datasets for various NLP tasks in AI. The project primarily deals with individual, spoken and semi-structured debates, such as classroom discussions, university panels, and informal discussions.

## Datasets

We call this corpus DEBISS (Debate Individual, Spontaneous, and Semi-Structured). From DEBISS, we have created many corpus that can be used for several NLP tasks.

Here, you will find a range of datasets resulting from research conducted by undergraduate and master's students of UFCG. Below are the available datasets:

### DEBISS - Transcription
Contains audio and transcriptions of small audio chunks. These can be used for training and evaluating audio-to-text models, voiceprint models, and diarization models.

### DEBISS-Arg - Argument Mining
Includes data with detailed information about argument structures in debate transcriptions. Useful for various Argument Mining tasks.

### DEBISS-Quali - Debater Quality
Contains information about the quality of the debater during the debating process, including argumentative skill, adherence to the subject, response quality, and more.

### DEBISS-Disf - Disfluency
Provides data labeled for speech disfluencies, which are common in audio transcriptions. This includes annotations for phenomena such as stuttering, repetition, and other disfluencies.
