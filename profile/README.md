## AINDA PROJECT UFCG

AINDA is a community of computer science and linguistics research with the goal of producing datasets that can be used in many NLP tasks within AI. The focus is on spoken and unstructured debates (for example, class discussions, university panels, or discussing a viewpoint with friends).

## Datasets

Here you will find a range of data. These datasets are the fruits of research promoted by undergraduate and master's degree students. Below are the available datasets:

### Transcription
Here you will find audio and transcriptions for small audio chunks. These can be used for training and evaluating audio-to-text models and voiceprint models.

### Argument
Here we have data with detailed information about the argument structure in the debate transcriptions. This can be used for several Argument Mining tasks.

### Debater Quality
This dataset contains information about the quality of the debater during the debating process, including argumentative skill, adherence to the subject, response quality, and much more.

### Disfluency
Here you will find data labeled for speech disfluency, which is very common in audio transcriptions.
